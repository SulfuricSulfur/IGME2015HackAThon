<p>Aisles of Chaos is a 2D 2-person multiplayer action game. The game can be played on a keyboard and on game-pads. The goal of the game is to get more points than your opponent within a certain time limit by collecting and selling the most items while also attacking your opponent to make them drop their items. The value of each item is different and the function of each item in combat is also different. The game is based in a super market and all items are objects that you can find within the store. The items spawn in random locations throughout the store.  If a player is hit with an item, the player will be frozen in place for a few seconds and all items in their inventory will drop.  </p>
